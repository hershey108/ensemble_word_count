# Overview
Simple application which will process a text string or a file and will provide the frequency of words in it, removing
any words that are a substring of other words and sorting them by length.

# Running

`java GetWordCount <optional path to file>`

If you include the path, the application will process it and immediately output the frequencies.

If you run it without the parameter, it will ask you to paste in a text string on one line.
